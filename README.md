The "StopSpam" module (stop-spam)
=================================

Provides some protection again spam using the knowledge base of [StopForumSpam](http://www.stopforumspam.com/)
and previously recorded IPs.

The module extends the _Comments_ module config block with its configuration, and the _Forms_
module manage block with stats about spam caught for each form.
